# CNC Technical AI

A chatbot which can provide detailed technical information about CNC machines as well as information about the components used in them.

## Note

This is a work in progress. This is for testing purposes only. It will almost certainly not work as intended and tell you incorrect information. Always double check with a
professional or suffer the consequences.

## Getting Started

To get started, just clone this repository and run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

It will require your own key for the openai api to be set in the .env
